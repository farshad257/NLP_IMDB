# 🔧 NLP Pipeline for Text Classification

Welcome to this powerful and streamlined **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project, where deep insights meet structured engineering. This notebook builds a comprehensive pipeline for **text preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **classification**, showcasing modern NLP tools in action.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **NLP workflow** designed to handle raw textual data, process it using a variety of techniques, and classify it into appropriate categories using machine learning models.

We cover everything from the foundations of text cleaning to the deployment of classification algorithms, making it a one-stop solution for applied NLP tasks.

## ✔️ Features and Workflow

Here's what this project offers:

### ✅ 1. **Text Preprocessing**
- Lowercasing and punctuation removal
- Tokenization and stopwords filtering
- Lemmatization using `spaCy`

### 📊 2. **Feature Extraction**
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**

### 💻 3. **Modeling**
- Multiple ML models tested:
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Logistic Regression**

### 📈 4. **Evaluation**
- Train-test splitting
- Accuracy and classification reports
- Model comparison and selection
